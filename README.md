YEP IT ONLY WORKS FOR WINDOWS im sorry, if you want to make a Mac version be my guess.

In resline.txt file you can change the vars MIN and MAX. 

In resline.pde you can change all the code. You can change the "size()" option to choosee the size of the canvas that you preferred.

IMPORTANT. Always keep files with the name Resline as Resline, or the whole plugin wonÂ´t work.

in the next updates you are gonna be able to control more than just one line
